Who is creep by?
Who wrote creep?
Who is creep by
Who wrote creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
You're so fucking special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
So fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door (run)
She's running out
She run, run, run, run,
Run...
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
